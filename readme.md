what is python?
- python is simple,easy & portable.
- python is free & open source.
- python is high level & interprtent language.
- python was developed by Guido van Rosum.


- python is interpretent language means when we write python code its excuated the code line by line thats we called python interprtent language.
print function to give output statement in python .simply we can tell"print" is output function.


charcter set of python language:-
1. letter->A-Z;a-z
2. Digital-0-9
3. Special character->-,+,/,* etc....
4. Whitespace->BLANK SPACE,Tab,newline


what is variable in python:- a variable is a name given to a memory location in a program or we can simply say variable is a container to store some data.

example-
name="shradha"
age=23
salary=23000.58

variable names=name,age,salary
variable values="shrdha",23,23000.58



Rules for identifiers;-
1. identifiers-name of the variables
2. identifies can combination of uppercase & lowercase letter ,digital or an underscore(_).ex- My Variable,varible_1
3. an identifier can not start with digit.so while variables is valid but 1varible in not valid
4. we can't use special character or symbol like !,#,@,% etc....
5. identifier can be of any length.
6. variables name should be small and meaningful like-when we give our age in that case we take the variables as"myAge".
myAge->camel case letter

- 'type'is a operator to show the datatypes name in our variables like which datatypeswe use in our variables


Comments in python:-
when we write some code but we don't want to excute it then we give the comment line to`that place so that line of code will not excuted.
1. single line comment-
when we give the single line comments.in python we did it on "#".
ex.
# single line comment
# this is a comment 
2. multi line comment-
when we give the multi line comment in python we did it though"""-"""
ex-
"""
    multi line 
    comments
    """"

- Types of operator:-
    simply we can say operator is a symbol that perform a certain operation between oprands
    ex.a+b
   a,b -> operands
    +->operator  
    there are 4 types operator present in python
    1. arithematic operator-(+,-,/,5,*)
    2. relational operator-(==,!=,>,<,>>=,<=)
    3. assignment operator-(=,+=,-=,/=,*=)
    4. logical operator-(and,or,not)


- Input in python:-
Input statement is use to accept values (use keyword)from user.

mainly data types of 5 types in python.
These data types are unmutable or bulid in data types 
1. Integer-+ve value,0,-ve value
2. String-"hello","mamaly"etc...
3. Float-3.91,4.00etc..
4. Boolean-True,False
5. None-not assign


Task to do for practice - 
1. write a program to input 2 numbers & print their sum
2. Write a program to input side of a square & print its area.
3. write a program to input 2 floating point numbers & print their average.
4. write a program to input 2 int numbers a & b, print True if a is greater then or equal to . if not print false.

- STRING:-
- string is a data type that stores a sequence of charcters.
str1="this is a good day .
str2='this is a beautiful day.'
str3="""this is a bad day"""
- all these string are real string because in python,it supports all the syntax


- /n (newline)-when we want to break our line into a new line then we can give the new line symbol in that place so the line get breaked automatically.

Basic Operation of string;-
1. concatenation->
"hello world"
2. length of string->
len(str)

- INDEXING OF STRING:-
- WEBBOCKET ->012345678(indexing)
- indexing always starts from'0"

SLICEING OF STRING->
- Accessing parts of a string.
- ending index is not counting.
- syntax-str[starting_index: ending_index]

str="webbocket"
str[0:3]-web
str[1:4]-ebb
str[:3]- web
str[3:]-bocket

- FUNCTION OF STRING:-
ex-
str="i am a coder."
1. str.endwith("er.")-returs true if string ends with substring.
2. str.capitalize()-returs 1st char is capital.
3. str.replace(old,new)-replace all ocurrances of old with new.
4. str.find(word)-returns 1st index of 1st occurrences.
5. str.count("am")-counts the occurance of substring in string. 


TASK TO DO PRATICE:-
1. Write a program to input users first name & prints its length.
2. write a program to find the ocurrancr of '$'in a string.

- CONDITIONAL STATEMENT:-
- used to handle the condition in your program.
- syntax(if-elif-else)
- elif means else-if

if(condition):
   statement1
elif(condition):
    statement2
 else:
    statement(default)


HOMEWORK:-
1. write a program to check if a number entered by the user if odd or even.
2. write a program to find the greatest of 3 number entered by a user.
3. write a program to check if a number is multiple of 7 or not.


LISTS IN PYTHON:-
- list is built in datatypes that stores set of values.
- it can store of different types like integer,float & string etc..
- in lists we can make indexing.
- in list we can find length of the list also.
- in list we can also do the slicing activity.
ex-
marks=(87,45,67,83,45)-array and list
student={"mamaly",85,"DKL"}-LIST---
- list in slicing:-
- it similar to string slicing.
- syntax:-list_name[starting _idx:ending_idx]
- ending index is not included.
marks=[23,25,67,78,98]
marks[1:4]->[25,67,98]
marks[:3]->[23,25,67]

LIST IN METHOD:-

list=[9,4,7,8,1]
list.append(6)-adds one elements at the end of the list-[9,4,7,8,1,6]
list.sort-sorts the element in ascending order-[1,4,7,8,9]
list.sort(reverse=True)-sorts the elements in descending order-[9,8,7,4,1]
list.reverse()-reversing the list-[1,8,7,4,9]
list.insert(idx,el)-insert the elements at index
list.remove(1)-remove the 1st ourrance of elements-[9,7,8,1]
list.pop(idx)-remove elements at index


- git->
- git is a open source respository(folder) system we can save,manipulate,collaborate our code with anyone else.
- in our software era,everyone can use gitsystem for their softwre development.
- we also called git is aversion control system.
- git provides some tools to use their functionality and features.
  ex-github,gitlab etc....
